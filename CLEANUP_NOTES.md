## ⚠️ Files to Delete Manually

The following files are unused and should be deleted:

1. **`src/components/dashboard.tsx`** - Old dashboard component (replaced by `src/pages/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)
2. **`src/components/layout.tsx`** - Unused layout component
3. **`src/components/profile.tsx`** - Unused profile component
4. **`src/components/profileform.tsx`** - Unused profile form component
5. **`src/components/uploadTrack.tsx`** - Unused upload track component
6. **`src/components/connectionRequests.tsx`** - Duplicate (replaced by `src/pages/Dashboard/ConnectionRequests.tsx`)

## 📝 Notes

### TypeScript Errors
The linter shows TypeScript module resolution errors. These are normal and will resolve when you:
```bash
npm install
```

### Theme Persistence
The light/dark mode preference is saved to `localStorage` and persists across sessions.

### Navigation Structure
```
Home (Dashboard) → /dashboard
Profil → /profile (currently shows Dashboard)
Comunitate → /community
Studio → /studio (only for producers)
Setări → /profile-edit
```

### Icons Used
Using `react-icons/fi` (Feather Icons) for consistency:
- FiHome - Home
- FiUser - Profile
- FiUsers - Community
- FiMic - Studio
- FiSun/FiMoon - Theme toggle
- FiSettings - Settings
- FiLogOut - Logout
- And more...

## 🎨 Design Improvements

1. **Color Scheme**
   - Primary: Indigo (indigo-600)
   - Accent: Purple gradient
   - Success: Green
   - Warning: Yellow
   - Danger: Red

2. **Gradients**
   - Avatar fallbacks: `from-indigo-500 to-purple-600`
   - Logo/Brand: `from-indigo-600 to-purple-600`

3. **Consistent Spacing**
   - Container: `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl`
   - Padding: `p-6`
   - Gaps: `gap-3`, `gap-4`, `gap-6`

4. **Transitions**
   - All interactive elements have smooth transitions
   - Dark mode transitions for seamless switching

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Delete the unused files listed above
2. Run `npm install` to resolve any package issues
3. Test the dark mode toggle
4. Test the navigation on both desktop and mobile
5. Verify producer-only Studio access
